# **Memory Game**

In this project, the challenge was to create a memory game using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## **Functionality**

In the classic game, each participant must, in turn, turn over two cards. If the figures are the same, the participant must pick up this pair and play again. If they are different pieces, they must be turned over again and the turn will be passed to the next participant.

The memory game of the project follows this same principle, however, when the client clicks on the cards, it will be the server who will turn them over and make the comparison regarding the equality or discrepancy of the two, leaving the figures fixed on the screen when the same or when different, turning them again.
